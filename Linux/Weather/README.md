#Fetch Weather info

Scripts I wrote to get weather information.

Update April 2016: As of March 2016, Yahoo has shut down public access to its weather API. It need OAUTH v1, which is insane since we cannot create pre-made auth tokens. (Needs user interaction, so these kind of server scripts are not possible). A detailed write-up is here: [Yahoo Weather API changes](https://www.igorkromin.net/index.php/2016/03/27/yahoo-effectively-shut-down-its-weather-api-by-forcing-oauth-10-and-crippling-it/). I'll update the scripts to use an alternative service soon. Please message me if you want it soon.
